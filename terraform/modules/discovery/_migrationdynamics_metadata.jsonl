{"id":"doc0","structData":{"title":"Migration Dynamics in Brazil: A Spatial Econometric Analysis","author":"Guilherme Viegas","year":2025,"relevance":["medium"],"abstract": "People are increasingly opting to migrate in pursuit of a better life, a trend that has substantially influenced the polarization of social and economic development observed in Brazil and abroad. Voluntary migration can be motivated by numerous reasons, yet economic opportunities seem to have a recurrent importance in modern migration. This study employs econometric models—including Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Spatial Auto Regression (SAR), Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), Mixed Geographically Weighted Regression (MixedGWR), and Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MultiscaleGWR)—to estimate the impact of socioeconomic factors on individuals' decisions to migrate to, from, and within Brazil. Through census data on emigration, immigration, and internal migration, the study aims to provide a broad understanding of migration determinants across 557 micro-regions of the federated Brazilian union by combining spatial econometric models and economic theory arguments. Additionally, the author provides a custom foundation model (LxM) to facilitate the exploration of referenced articles and books through a generative discovery search engine for his thesis. The concluding remarks highlight the importance of broader policies to mitigate migration issues, as it is a cause and a consequence of economic concentration in a multiscale core-periphery socioeconomic system.","keywords":["Migration", "Core-Periphery", "Brazil", "Spatial Econometrics", "Globalization"],"language":"English","type":"master_thesis"},"content":{"mimeType":"application/pdf","uri":"gs://discovery-bucket-personalhub11/master_thesis_2025.pdf"}}
