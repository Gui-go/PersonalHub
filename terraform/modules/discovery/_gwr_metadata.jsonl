It allows spatial heterogeneities in processes andrelationships to be investigated through a series of local regression models rather thana single global one. Standard GWR assumes that relationships between the response andpredictor variables operate at the same spatial scale, which is frequently not the case. Toaddress this, several GWR variants have been proposed. This paper describes a route mapto decide whether to use a GWR model or not, and if so which of three core variants toapply: a standard GWR, a mixed GWR or a multiscale GWR (MS-GWR). The route mapcomprises 3 primary steps that should always be undertaken: (1) a basic linear regression,(2) a MS-GWR, and (3) investigations of the results of these in order to decide whether touse a GWR approach, and if so for determining the appropriate GWR variant. The paperalso highlights the importance of investigating a number of secondary issues at global andlocal scales including collinearity, the influence of outliers, and dependent error terms.Code and data for the case study used to illustrate the route map are provided.","keywords":["GWR"],"language":"English","type":"publication"},"content":{"mimeType":"application/pdf","uri":"gs://discovery-bucket-personalhub11/2023_a_route_map_for_successful_applications_of_geographically_weighted_regression.pdf"}}
