# openlayers/openlayers (as a base for custom apps): Similar to Leaflet, OpenLayers is a powerful JavaScript library for displaying map data in web browsers. Containerize your application that uses it.   
# keplergl/kepler.gl (as a base for custom apps or pre-built demos): Kepler.gl is a powerful open-source geospatial visualization tool for large-scale datasets. You can containerize a web server hosting pre-configured Kepler.gl instances.   
# streamlit/streamlit (for geospatial dashboards): Streamlit is a Python library that makes it easy to create interactive web applications and dashboards. You can build compelling geospatial data visualizations with it and containerize the app.   
# plotly/dash (for interactive mapping): Dash is a Python framework for building analytical web applications. It has excellent support for interactive maps through libraries like plotly.express.   
# Geocoding & Reverse Geocoding:

# nominatim/nominatim: A powerful open-source geocoding service based on OpenStreetMap data. Running your own instance gives you control and privacy. (Note: Can be resource-intensive for large areas).   
# photon-geocoder/photon: Another fast, open-source geocoder built on top of Elasticsearch and OpenStreetMap data. Lighter than a full Nominatim instance.   
# pelias/api: A modular open-source geocoding and search service. You can choose the components you need.

# GNSS & Tracking:

# traccar/traccar: An open-source GPS tracking server that supports a wide range of devices. You can host your own tracking platform for vehicles, assets, or even personal devices.   
# gpsd/gpsd: A service daemon that monitors one or more GPS or AIS receivers attached to a host computer through serial or USB ports, making the data available to be queried by client applications. Useful if you have physical GPS hardware connected to your server.   
# Fun & Experimental:

# blender/blender (for geospatial visualization): While not strictly a geospatial tool, Blender can be used for advanced 3D visualization of terrain and other geographic data. You can run Blender in a container for rendering tasks.   
# Containers hosting Jupyter Notebooks with geospatial libraries (e.g., jupyter/datascience-notebook with geopandas, rioxarray, etc. installed): Great for interactive exploration and analysis of geospatial data.


# apache/airflow:2.x: Platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows.

# dbtlabs/dbt-core: Transformation workflow tool that lets teams quickly and collaboratively deploy analytics code.

# apache/hadoop:latest-jdk8: Apache Hadoop environment (can be resource-intensive for a full cluster). You might start with a single-node setup.
